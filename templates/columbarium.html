    <p>The Monks of Mepkin Abbey have been living beside the Cooper River since 1949, caring for the land with its many
        layers of history. Our Bell Tower is dedicated to the spirits of all those who have lived on, loved, and worked
        this land, as well as those who are buried here. Seven times a day, the Bells of this tower, known as The
        Spirits of These People, call us to prayer and join us in our devotion.</p>

    <p>Our land is our greatest asset at Mepkin Abbey. In addition to aspiring to be good stewards of this land, we have
        continually strived to use it for the benefit of others so that they too may share in the serenity, beauty, and
        peace with which God has blessed this place. The seventy-plus years of monks praying here have indeed sanctified
        this Sacred Ground.</p>

    <p>In a tangible way, we provide the opportunity to share in this peace and serenity by constructing a Columbarium
        Wall with niches to inurn the cremated remains of loved ones. We see this as an extension of our hospitality for
        those, of any faith or beyond the household of faith, who have some affinity with the life that is lived here, a
        reverence for the beauty of this place, and who are looking for a sacred resting place of reflection and
        remembrance for their cremated remains, or those of their loved ones.</p>

    <p>In addition to incorporating deceased loved ones into our prayer life and into our cherished landscape by the
        Cooper River, we offer you the opportunity to help support a continued monastic presence in the Lowcountry
        through the purchase of a columbarium niche.</p>

    <p>For assistance and to answer any questions you may have, please call David George at (843) 568-5789 or contact us
        at <a href="mailto:ColumbariumatMepkin@gmail.com">ColumbariumatMepkin@gmail.com</a>.</p>
