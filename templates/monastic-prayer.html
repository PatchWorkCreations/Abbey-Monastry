        <i>(Please join us in prayer for monastic vocations.)</i><br>
<br>
        Gracious and Loving God<br>
        In every generation you call men and women<br>
        To leave everything<br>
<br>
        Following Christ into the desert<br>
        Being of one heart and one mind in peace, humility, and simplicity<br>
<br>
        We come before you now asking for the grace<br>
        To be faithful to our vocation<br>
        Striving to live in the communion of Love which surpasses all other gifts<br>
<br>
        May men and women of our time<br>
        Hear the call to live the Gospel in the monastic way<br>
        In service of the Churchâ€™s mission<br>
        By constantly seeking your face in prayer, work, and community life<br>
<br>
        Remember our Cistercian communities<br>
        Those aging and those newly born<br>
        Throughout the world, north and south, east and west<br>
<br>
        As you have done from the days of our founders<br>
        Bless us once again<br>
        May our brotherhood at Mepkin grow in numbers, in grace, and in wisdom<br>
        So that we might continue to live for your glory with greater vigor<br>
        And with joy never ending. Amen.<br>
